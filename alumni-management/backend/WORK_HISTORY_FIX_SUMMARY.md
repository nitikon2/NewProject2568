# Work History API 500 Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The work history API at `/api/work-history` was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to save work history data from the frontend.

## Root Cause
The database schema and the API route had a mismatch in column names:

1. **Missing Column**: The `technologies_used` column was missing from the database
2. **Column Mismatch**: The route was trying to insert `team_size` but this column didn't exist initially
3. **Parameter Count Mismatch**: The number of parameters in the INSERT statement didn't match the number of placeholders

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added missing `technologies_used` column to `work_history` table
- ✅ Added missing `team_size` column to `work_history` table

### 2. API Route Fixes (`routes/workHistory.js`)
- ✅ Updated POST route to include all required fields including `team_size`
- ✅ Updated PUT route to include all required fields including `team_size`  
- ✅ Fixed INSERT statement column list and parameter count
- ✅ Fixed UPDATE statement column list and parameter count

### 3. Database Operations Fixed
**INSERT Statement Now Includes:**
```sql
INSERT INTO work_history 
(user_id, company_name, company_type, industry, company_size, position, department, job_level, 
 job_description, start_date, end_date, is_current, employment_type, salary_range, 
 location, work_province, work_district, team_size, skills_used, technologies_used, key_achievements)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

**UPDATE Statement Now Includes:**
```sql
UPDATE work_history 
SET company_name = ?, company_type = ?, industry = ?, company_size = ?, position = ?, 
    department = ?, job_level = ?, job_description = ?, start_date = ?, end_date = ?, 
    is_current = ?, employment_type = ?, salary_range = ?, location = ?, work_province = ?, 
    work_district = ?, team_size = ?, skills_used = ?, technologies_used = ?, key_achievements = ?
WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?
```

### 4. Test Files Updated
- ✅ Updated test files to include `team_size` field in test data
- ✅ Verified database operations work correctly

## Final Status
- ✅ Database schema is complete with all required columns
- ✅ API routes handle all work history fields correctly
- ✅ INSERT operations work without 500 errors
- ✅ UPDATE operations work without 500 errors
- ✅ All column counts match between SQL and parameters

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Start the backend server: `npm start` from `/alumni-management/backend`
2. Start the frontend: `npm start` from `/alumni-management/frontend`
3. Login to the application
4. Navigate to Work History section
5. Try adding a new work history entry
6. The operation should complete successfully without 500 errors

## Files Modified
1. `routes/workHistory.js` - Fixed API endpoints
2. Database: Added missing columns via `add_missing_work_columns.js`
3. Test files: Updated to include correct fields

The 500 Internal Server Error has been resolved and work history operations now function correctly.
